Key Points:
- Develop new features in a side branch of my repositories
- Learn and get more practice on Git and Vims

Today I decided to clean up all the commits of my main branch, I should have use another branch for development and avoiding so many commits and potentially mess up my website.
I ended up to move the files to an new repository because it is too much works squashing all the commits 
(or maybe it is just because I am not familar with Git and Vims).
Here are some useful resources for rebasing the main branch and squash all the commits:
- [How to squash all git commits into one?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1657017/how-to-squash-all-git-commits-into-one)
  > If you have many commits it's hard to change 'pick' to 'squash' manually. Use :%s/pick/squash/g in VIM command line to do this faster.
