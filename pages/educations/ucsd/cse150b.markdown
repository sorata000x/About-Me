## Description

Introduces important ideas and algorithms in search and reasoning and demonstrate how they are used in practical AI applications. 

## Topic

Heuristic search (A*)
 - Path search in positively weighted graph (could apply to arbitrary weight with Bellman-Ford)
 - Always finds the best path (like Dijkstra), but faster

Adversarial search
 - Prediction and planning in a two player situation
 - Minimax, Expectimax algorithm

Monte Carlo tree search

Reinforcement learning

Constraint solving and optimization

Propositional and first-order reasoning
