## Description

Introduces important ideas and algorithms in search and reasoning and demonstrate how they are used in practical AI applications. 

## Topic

- Heuristic search (A*)
  - Path search in positively weighted graph (could apply to arbitrary weight with Bellman-Ford)
  - Always finds the best path (like Dijkstra), but faster
- Adversarial search
  - Prediction and planning in a two player situation
  - Minimax, Expectimax algorithm
- Monte Carlo tree search
- Reinforcement learning
- Constraint solving and optimization
- Propositional and first-order reasoning
